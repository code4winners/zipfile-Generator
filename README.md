Overall Flow
Step 1: You write the Lambda function in lambda_function.py.

Step 2: You run create_lambda.py to package the Lambda function into a ZIP file and deploy it to AWS Lambda.

The script creates lambda_function.zip and uploads it.

Step 3: You use invoke_lambda.py to trigger the Lambda function and see the output.
